### Raw Code

A place to stick code that doesn't have any packaging scripts.

A git repository cloned directly from the author would be a generic example. It may include build scripts to produce binaries but won't necessarily have a PKGBUILD.
AUR repositories are often layered on top of the vendor repositories. https://github.com/symless/synergy-core is a specific example of raw code. It doesn't have any ArchLinux packaging scripts. It does have CMake 
scripts and scripts to build Debian packages. This would be a repository that goes in here.
